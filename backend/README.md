## Multi-School Review and Choice Workflow

### School-Specific Review System

The admission system supports independent review by each school in the student's preference list. Each school can accept or reject applications independently.

#### For School Managers/Admins

##### 1. Get Applications for Review
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/admissions/school-review/`
- Returns applications where the current user's school is in the preference list
- Each application includes current decision status for the school

**Response**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "reference_id": "ADM-2025-A1B2C3",
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "email": "student@example.com",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "date_of_birth": "2005-06-15",
    "preferred_school_1": "Acharya Primary School",
    "preferred_school_2": "Acharya Secondary School",
    "status": "pending",
    "submitted_at": "2025-01-17T10:30:00Z",
    "school_decisions": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "school": "Acharya Primary School",
        "status": "pending"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

##### 2. Update School Decision
**Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/v1/admissions/school-decision/{decision_id}/`

```json
{
  "status": "accepted",  // "accepted", "rejected", or "pending"
  "notes": "Excellent academic record and good interview performance"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "school": "Acharya Primary School",
  "status": "accepted",
  "review_date": "2025-01-18T14:30:00Z",
  "notes": "Excellent academic record and good interview performance"
}
```

### Student Choice System

When a student is accepted by multiple schools, they must choose which school to attend.
